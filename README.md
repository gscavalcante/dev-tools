Dev Tools
=========

This is my personal configuration to use at Linux.

## How to use?

Tell your bash that you want to use this package. Add to line below to your .bashrc,
.bashprofile, or .zshrc.

```
source ${DEV_TOOLS_DIR}/core.sh
```

## Bash

Add some configurations at the bash, things like:

- Git branch after the folder name;
- Some colors;
